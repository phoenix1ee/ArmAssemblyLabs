# Collection of Labs on ARM assembly (32bit)

This is a collection of labs on written in 32 bit ARM assembly, and a project on demonstrating the concept of RSA encryption.

Final product of the project of RSA encryption is a library file of 32-bit ARM assembly, containing functions to perform key generations, encryption and decryption calculations

## How to run:

1. Modify / code your own program in arm assembly and call the functions when needed.
2. Use any 32bit OS ARM based machine and gcc/make to link and produce your own program with the library file
